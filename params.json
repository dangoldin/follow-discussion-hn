{"name":"Follow-discussion-hn","tagline":"Follow the discussion on HN js plugin","body":"This is a pretty simple JS plugin to retrieve the HN comment thread for a given URL. The motivation behind the plugin was that I've been reading a lot of posts recently that have a \"Follow this discussion on Hacker News\" link at the bottom but until you submit the post you can't really add that link. The plugin tries to solve that.\r\n\r\nThis is the approach:\r\n\r\n1. Use Firebase to store the links. Since it can be used via client side JS it doesn't require running a backend server.\r\n2. Use the http://hndroidapi.appspot.com/ API to retrieve a user's recent submissions and then find the match.\r\n\r\nIn hindsight, it's not really necessary to have Firebase here at all except for efficiency's sake and to get to play around with it.\r\n\r\nPlugin Limitations:\r\n\r\n1. It will only look at a user's most recent submissions but after the first retrieval it should be stored in Firebase.\r\n2. It depends on both Firebase and an unofficial HN API so either of those can break at any moment.\r\n3. Since the Firebase location is public it's pretty easy for someone to overwrite the data. Authentication, which Firebase seems to support, would fix this.\r\n4. This is my first \"real\" Javascript plugin so use at your own risk.\r\n\r\nSample page:\r\n\r\n    <html>\r\n    <head>\r\n      <title>Follow Discussion on HN Plugin</title>\r\n      <script src='https://cdn.firebase.com/v0/firebase.js'></script>\r\n    </head>\r\n    <body>\r\n      <div class=\"result\"></div>\r\n\r\n      <script src=\"//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.9.1/jquery.min.js\"></script>\r\n      <script src=\"js/hn.follow.js\"></script>\r\n      <script type=\"text/javascript\">\r\n        $(document).ready(function(){\r\n          var loc = window.location;\r\n          var curr_url = loc.protocol + '//' + loc.host + loc.pathname;\r\n\r\n          var hn = new $.followHN({\r\n            username: 'dangoldin',\r\n            firebase_url: 'https://follow-on-hn.firebaseio.com/urls',\r\n            callback: function(thread_url) {\r\n              $('.result').html('Follow discussion on <a href=\"' + thread_url + '\">Hacker News</a>');\r\n            }\r\n          });\r\n          hn.get_hn_url(curr_url);\r\n        });\r\n      </script>\r\n    </body>\r\n    </html>\r\n\r\n## Copyright and license\r\n\r\nLicensed under The MIT License (MIT)\r\nCopyright (c) 2013 Dan Goldin\r\n\r\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\r\n\r\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\r\n\r\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
